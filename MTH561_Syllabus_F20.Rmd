## Course description and objectives 

Introduction to probability and probability distributions including techniques for finding expected values and variance of discrete and continuous variables. These distributions and their properties are examined to establish their application to applied statistical methods.

MTH 561 also addresses Department of Mathematics Learning Objectives 2 and 4.

- Objective 2. Communication in Mathematics: The ability to communicate effectively in both oral and written forms while applying their mathematical skills. Students will learn the basic language of proof and counterexample. Students will organize and present significant ideas and calculations in written form.
- 	Objective 4. Breadth and Depth: Students will develop an awareness of the breadth and depth of mathematics. This will include an awareness of historical and contemporary contexts in which mathematics is practiced. They will develop critical perspectives of the inherent limitations of the discipline.


## Course materials and resources

BlueLine will be your main resource for class notes, lecture videos, data sets, software resources, and assignments. You should expect an announcement every Monday letting you know what's due over the next week, and what material we will be covering.

The required book for this course is listed below. All students should have access to either a physical or e-copy of the textbook.

- Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer, __Mathematical Statistics with Applications__ (7th Edition). ISBN-13: 978-0495110811

```{r, out.width='20%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

```

## Course format and organization

For this semester, we'll be trying out a flipped class format. This means I'll provide you with pre-recorded lecture videos for you to watch on your own time. (Just make sure you watch them in advance of the date listed on the BlueLine calendar!) Our scheduled in-person class meetings will consist of practice problems, review, and interactive lab activities.

In-person class meetings will cover the same content on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Tuesday's session will also be recorded for students unable to attend class physically.

Each week in MTH 561 will, for the most part, look something like this:

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('Fall2020_FlowDiagram.png')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = LightBlue]
node[fontname = 'helvetica', width = 1.5, height = 0.5]

videos [label = 'Monday: \n Watch lecture videos and \n complete concept check', fillcolor = '#FBB4AE']
lab_a [label = 'Tuesday (A): \n Attend assigned in-person  \n session and complete \n lab activity', fillcolor = '#B3CDE3']
lab_b [label = 'Thursday (B): \n Attend assigned in-person  \n session and complete \n lab activity', fillcolor = '#CCEBC5']
homework [label =  'Sunday: \n Submit homework assignment \n (due at 11:59 pm)', fillcolor = '#DECBE4']

videos -> {lab_a lab_b} -> homework
}")
```

## Course assessment 

Your grade in MTH 561 will contain the following components.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

grades <- tribble(
  ~category,  ~percent,
  "Homework and lab activities", 50,
  "Concept checks", 10,
  "Midterm exams (2)", 25,
  "Final exam", 15
)

grades$category <- fct_relevel(grades$category, 'Concept checks', 'Homework and lab activities', 'Midterm exams (2)', 'Final exam')

grades$location <- rep(1, 4)

grades %>% ggplot(aes(x=location, y=percent)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=category), col='black') + 
  guides(fill=FALSE) + 
  geom_text(aes(x=rep(1, 4), 
                label=c('Concept checks (10%)', 
                        'Homework and lab activities (50%)', 
                        'Midterm exams (25%)', 
                        'Final exam (15%)'), 
                y=c(95, 65, 27.5, 7.5))) + 
  labs(x='', y='Cumulative percent') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=pal)

```

1. Concept checks (10%): After watching each week's lecture videos, you'll complete a short concept check in BlueLine. These will consist of multiple choice or short calculation formulas designed to test for basic comprehension of the video contents.
2.	Homework and lab activities (50%): Homework will be collected approximately once a week. All answers must be readable and neatly written. Students should show their work for complete credit on homeworks. Where applicable, supporting R code should also be provided. Lab activities will be graded on a combination of completeness and correctness.
3.	Midterm Exams (25%): There will be two Midterm Exams in this course. Midterm Exam 1 will be available from September 18-20 and Midterm Exam 2 will be available from October 23-25. Exam dates will not change, but coverage will depend on our progress in the course. Midterm Exams will be administered in BlueLine.
4.	Final Exam (15%): The Final Exam will be on Thursday, November 19. The Final Exam will be cumulative, and cover all material from the semester. Like the Midterms, the Final Exam will be administered in BlueLine.


All assignments must be readable, and when appropriate, all work must be shown to receive credit. Late work will receive a 25% deduction per calendar day, with no work accepted more than 3 calendar days after the deadline (unless other arrangements have been made _before_ the due date). 

All exams and in-class work must be completed at the scheduled time. A missed exam or quiz will result in a score of zero unless you contact me before class with a note from your advisor, physician, organization, or coach stating explicit reasons for your absence. 

Adjustments may be made in extraordinary circumstances.

## Letter grades

Final course grades will be determined according to the following scale.

Letter Grade|Weighted Score
---|---
A|93-100%
A-|90-92.99%
B+|87-89.99%
B|83-86.99%
B-|80-82.99%
C+|77-79.99%
C|73-76.99%
C-|70-72.99%
D|60-69.99%
F|<59.99%

The grade cutoffs may be shifted _downward_ at the end of the semester based on student performance (never upward).

## Class preparation 

Students should come to each in-person class meeting prepared to write and talk intelligently about the material. This means watching all required videos or reading all required materials before class. The assignments will require thought and analysis, which cannot be had in 15 minutes or less. Give yourself adequate time to read carefully, to think and reflect, to sleep on it, then maybe glance it over before class.

## Computing and software 

Computing is an essential part of modern statistical practice. We will be using the open-source statistical computing language R and user interface program RStudio to graph probability distributions, calculate probabilities, demonstrate theoretical results, and investigate complex problems. Students may check out laptops for three days at a time from Reinert-Alumni Memorial Library.

## Attendance policy 

All students are expected to come to class on their assigned days prepared to learn and actively participate. However, if you must be absent check BlueLine for assignments, announcements, and any other information you may have missed. 

### COVID-19 symptoms

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Infected people have had a wide range of symptoms reported – from mild symptoms to severe illness.

Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

- Fever or chills
- Cough
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- Fatigue
- Muscle or body aches
- Headache
- New loss of taste or smell
- Sore throat
- Congestion or runny nose
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea

__If you or anyone whom you have been in close contact with is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, please do not attend class and notify Dr. Schwab-McCoy of your absence.__

## Cancellation of class 

Generally speaking, if the University is open, you can expect class to meet. But, should we have to cancel class for inclement weather or due to illness, an announcement will be made at least 45 minutes before the start of class via (1) email to the entire class and (2) a posted announcement on BlueLine. If an assignment is scheduled for that day, the new due date will be included in the message. The University Weather Hotline is 402-280-5800.

Rarely, it may be necessary to cancel a class on rather short notice. In that case, the procedure above will be followed or another professor will make an announcement at the start of class. In this case, assignments will not be cancelled or postponed.

## Academic honesty 

This course is governed by the Policy on Academic Honesty of the College of Arts and Science. The CCAS policy on academic honesty can be found at the link below.
https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/curriculum/CCAS_Academic_Honesty_Policy_.pdf
You are encouraged to work together on homework labs and in-class activities, but all work you submit must be your own (unless the assignment specifically states otherwise). A first act of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero on the item in question. A subsequent offense will result in an F for the course. Students should consult the Academic Honesty Procedures if they have any questions.
